I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give mе the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til thе sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

Into the car
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough
Mmm, you got me feelin' like

I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing we started
I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver-er-er
Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing we started
I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver
Yeah, you got me singin' like

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back (Oh, no)
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back, hey
