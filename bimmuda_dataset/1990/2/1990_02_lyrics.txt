It must have been love
But it's over now

Lay a whisper on my pillow
Leave the winter on the ground
I wake up lonely
This air of silence
In the bedroom and all around
Touch me now
I close my eyes
And dream away

It must have been love
But it's over now
It must have been good
But I lost it somehow
It must have been love
But it's over now
From the moment we touched
Till the time had run out

Make believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside
I turn to water
Like a teardrop in your palm
And it's a hard
Winter's day
I dream away

It must have been love
(Must have been love)
But it's over now
(It's over now)
It was all that I wanted
Now I'm living without
It must have been love
(Must have been love)

But it's over now
(It's over now)
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

It must have been love
(Must have been love)
But it's over now
(It's over now)
It must have been good
But I lost it somehow
It must have been love
(Must have been love)
But it's over now
(It's over now)
From the moment we touched
Till the time had run out
Yeah, it must have been love
(Must have been love)
But it's over now
(It's over now)
It was all that I wanted
Now I'm living without
It must have been love
But it's over now
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

(Must have been love)
It must have been love
But it's over now
No, no, no
