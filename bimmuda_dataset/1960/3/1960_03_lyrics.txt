Don't want your love any more
Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown

I've got to stand tall, you know a man can't crawl
For when he knows you're telling lies
And he hears them passing by
He's not a man at all

Don't want your love any more
Don't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown

When you see me shed a tear
And you know that it's sincere
Don't you think it's kind of sad, that you're treating me so bad?
Or don't you even care?

Don't want your love any more
Don't want your kisses , that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes, that's Cathy's clown
That's Cathy's clown, that's Cathy's clown
