I don't like no whips and chains, and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Whip your lovin' on me, baby

I'm vanilla, baby, I'll choke you, but I ain't no killer, baby (I don't like no whips and chains)
She 28, telling me I'm still a baby (and you can't tie me down)
I get love from Detroit like Skilla Baby (but you can whip your lovin' on me, baby)
And the thing about your boy is (whip your lovin' on me, baby)
I don't like no whips and chains, and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby (that's right, that's right)
Whip your lovin' on me, baby

Young J-A-C-K, AKA Rico, like Suave, Young Enrique
Speaking of AKA, she's a alpha
But not around your boy, she get quiet 'round your boy, hold on (shh)
Don't know what you heard or what you thought about your boy
But they lied about your boy, goin' dumb, and it's some' idiotic about your boy
She wearing cheetah print
That's how bad she wanna be spotted around your boy

I don't like no whips and chains
And you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Whip your lovin' on me, baby

I'm vanilla, baby, I'll choke you, but I ain't no killer, baby (I don't like no whips and chains)
She 28, telling me I'm still a baby (and you can't tie me down)
I get love from Detroit like Skilla Baby (but you can whip your lovin' on me, baby)
And the thing about your boy is (whip your lovin' on me, baby)
I don't like no whips and chains, and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby

Young M-I-S-S-I-O-N-A-R-Y
You sharp like barbed wire
She stole my heart, then she got archived
I keep it short with a b-, Lord Farquaad
All the girls in the front row (ayy)
All the girls in the barricade (ayy)
All the girls that been waiting all day, let your tongue hang out, f- everything (ayy)
If you came with a man (yeah, yeah)
Let go of his hand (let go of that -)
Everybody in the suite, kicking up they feet, stand up, b-, dance

I don't like no whips and chains (I see you)
And you can't tie me down (and all the guys in the back waiting for the next track)
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby (cut your boy a lil' slack)
Whip your lovin' on me, baby (it's young Jack)

I'm vanilla, baby, I'll choke you, but I ain't no killer, baby (I don't like no whips and chains)
She 28, telling me I'm still a baby (and you can't tie me down)

Whip your lovin' on me, baby

I don't like no whips and chains, and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Whip your lovin' on me, baby
