You got a lotta nerve, don't you, baby?
I only hit the curb 'cause you made me
You're tellin' all your friends that I'm crazy
Like I'm the only one
Why'd you throw them stones, if you
Had a wild hair of your own or two?
Livin' in your big glass house with a view
I thought you knew

I had some help
It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf
Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell
They say teamwork makes the dream work
Hell, I had some help (help)

You thought I'd take the blame for us a-crumblin'
Go 'round like you ain't guilty of somethin'
Already lost the game that you been runnin'
Guess it's catchin' up to you, huh
You think that you're so innocent
After all the shit you did
I ain't an angel, you ain't heaven-sent
Can't wash our hands of this

I had some help
It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf
Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell
They say, "Teamwork makes the dream work"
Hell, I had some help (help)

It takes two to break a heart in two, ooh
Baby, you blame me and, baby, I blame you
Aw, if that ain't truth (oh)

I had some help
It ain't like I can make this kinda mess all by myself
Don't act like you ain't help me pull that bottle off the shelf
Been deep in every weekend if you couldn't tell
They say teamwork makes the dream work
Hell, I had some help (help)
