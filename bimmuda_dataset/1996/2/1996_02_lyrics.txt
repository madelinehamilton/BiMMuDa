Sorry I've never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away, so far away

Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive, alive

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (Together)
One sweet day
(And I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven)

Darling, I never showed you (No, no, no, no)
Assumed you'd always be there (Always there)
I thought you'd always be there
I, I took your presence for granted
But I always cared (But I always cared)
And I miss the love we shared (Yeah, and I know)

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way (Lost along the way)
And I know eventually we'll be together (Oh, no, I know)
One sweet day
(And I'll wait patiently to see you in heaven)

(Although the sun will never shine the same again)
(I'll always look to a brighter day) Yeah, yeah
Lord, I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray

And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day (One sweet day)
And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (Yes, we will)
(One sweet day) One sweet day

Sorry, I never told you
All I wanted to say
