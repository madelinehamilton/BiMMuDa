Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby

Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me
How you want it to be
Tell me, baby
'Cause I need to know now
Oh, because

My loneliness is killing me (And I)
I must confess, I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty, baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Show me
How you want it to be
Tell me, baby
'Cause I need to know now
Oh, because

My loneliness is killing me (And I)
I must confess, I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby (Oh)
Oh, baby, baby (Yeah)

Oh, baby, baby
How was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
I must confess that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here and give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

My loneliness is killing me (And I)
I must confess, I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

I must confess that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here and give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
