Oooh,
Just can't believe this man
(Metro Boomin want some more --)

Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you, I just kept it to myself

I don't wanna know, if you're playing me
Keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creeping, please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know

I think about it when I hold you
When looking in your eyes, I can't believe
And I don't need to know the truth
But baby keep it to yourself

I don't wanna know, if you're playing me
Keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creeping, please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know

Did he touch you better than me? (touch you better than me?)
Did he watch you fall asleep (watch you fall asleep?)
Did you show him all those things that you used to do to me?
If you're better off that way (better off that way)
Baby all that I can say (all that I can say)
If you're gonna do your thing, then don't come back to me
Ooh

Woah, woah, woah
21
Had me crushing, I was cuffing like the precinct
How you go from housewife to a sneaky link
Got you ridin round in all types of benz's and rovers
Girl you used to ride in a rinky dink
I'm the one put you in Eliante (on God)
Fashion Nova model, I put you on the runway (on God)
You was rocking coach bags, got you chanaynay
Side --in frisco, I call her my bae bae (21)
I got a girl but I still feel alone
If you playing me that mean my home aint home
Having nightmares of going through your phone (21)
Can't even record you got me out my zone

I don't wanna know, if you're playing me
Keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creeping, please don't let it show
Oh baby
I don't wanna know, if you're playing me
Keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creeping, please don't let it show
Oh baby I don't wanna know

If you creeping just don't let me find out (on God)
Get a hotel never bring him to the house (on God)
If you're better off that way (better off that way)
Baby all that I can say (all that I can say)
If you're gonna do your thing, then don't come back to me
