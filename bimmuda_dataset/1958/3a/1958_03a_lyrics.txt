Don't, don't, that's what you say
Each time that I hold you this way
When I feel like this and I want to kiss you
Baby, don't say don't
Don't don't

Don't, don't leave my embrace
For here in my arms is your place
When the night grows cold and I want to hold you
Baby, don't say don't
Don't don't don't

If you think that this is just a game
I'm playing
If you think that I don't mean
Every word I'm saying
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't feel that way
I'm your love and yours I will stay

This you can believe
I will never leave you
Heaven knows I won't
Baby, don't say don't
Don't please don't
