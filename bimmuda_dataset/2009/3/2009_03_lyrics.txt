Konvict
Gaga (Oh-oh, eh)

I've had a little bit too much, much (Oh, oh, oh-oh)
All of the people start to rush (Start to rush by)
A dizzy twister dance, can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys? I lost my phone, phone (Oh, oh, oh-oh)

What's goin' on, on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club?
I can't remember, but it's alright, a-alright

Just dance
Gonna be okay, da-da-doo-doot-n
Just dance
Spin that record, babe, da-da-doo-doot-n
Just dance
Gonna be okay
Da-da-da-dance, dance, dance
Just, j-j-just dance

Wish I could shut my playboy mouth (Oh, oh, oh-oh)
How'd I turn my shirt inside out? (Inside out, right)
Control your poison, babe, roses have thorns, they say
And we're all gettin' hosed tonight (Oh, oh, oh-oh)

What's goin' on, on the floor?
I love this record, baby, but I can't see straight anymore

Spin that record, babe, da-da-doo-doot-n

When I come through on the dance floor, checking out that catalogue (Hey)
Can't believe my eyes, so many women without a flaw
And I ain't gon' give it up, steady, tryna pick it up like a call
I'mma hit it, I'mma beat it up, latch onto it until tomorrow, yeah
Shorty, I can see that you got so much energy
The way you twirlin' up them hips 'round and 'round
And there is no reason at all why you can't leave here with me
In the meantime, stay, let me watch you break it down and

Dance

Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic, got my blueprint, it's symphonic
Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic, got my blueprint, electronic
Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic, got my blueprint, it's symphonic
Half psychotic, sick, hypnotic, got my blueprint, electronic
Go, use your muscle, carve it out, work it, hustle

Don't slow, drive it, clean it, Lysol, bleed it
Spend the last dough (I got it) in your pock-o (I got it)
