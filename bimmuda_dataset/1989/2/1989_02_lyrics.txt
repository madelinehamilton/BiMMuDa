Get busy!

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me (Now now)
Why don't they just let me live? (Ooh)
I don't need permission
Make my own decisions (OH!)
That's my prerogative

They say I'm crazy, I really don't care
That's my prerogative
They say I'm nasty, but I don't give a damn
Getting girls is how I live
Some ask me questions, "Why am I so real?"
But they don't understand me or really don't know the deal
About a brother, trying hard to make it right
Not long ago, before I win this fight (sing)

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission
Make my own decisions (OH!)
That's my prerogative

It's the way that I wanna live (It's my prerogative)
I can do just what I feel (It's my prerogative)
No one can tell me what to do (It's my prerogative)
'Cause what I'm doing
I'm doing for you, now

Don't get me wrong, I'm really not souped
Ego trips is not my thing
All these strange relationships really gets me down
I see nothing wrong with spreading myself around (sing)

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me (Yeah)
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission (I don't need...)
Make my own decisions (...my own decisions)
That's my prerogative

It's my prerogative (It's my prerogative)
I can do what I wanna do (It's my prerogative)
Can live my life (It's my prerogative)
I'm doing it just for you (It's my prerogative)

Tell me, tell me, why can't I live my life (Live my life)
Without all of the things that people say

Yo Teddy, kick it like this
Oh, no, no
I can do what I wanna do
Me and you
Together, together, together, together, together

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
(Everybody's talking)
Why don't they just let me live?
(Why don't they just let me live, girl?)
I don't need permission
Make my own decisions
(I don't need permission from nobody)
That's my prerogative

Everybody's talking all this stuff about me
(Everybody's talking)
Why don't they just let me live? (Now)
I don't need permission (I don't need...)
Make my own decisions (...my own decisions)
That's my prerogative

What is this, a blizzard, that I can't have money in my pocket
And people not talk about me?
This world is a trip; I don't know what's going on these days
Got this person over here talking about me, this person
Ay, listen, let me tell you something, it's my prerogative
I can do what I wanna do
I made this money, you didn't; right, Ted?
We outta here!

It's my, it's my, it's my, it's my
It's my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
It's my...WOO!
It's my prerogative, it's my...
It's my, it's my, my, my
It's my prerogative, can't you see, baby doll?
Ha, why you wanna talk about me?
Tell me, tell me why...
