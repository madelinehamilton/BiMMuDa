So many times
Said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Something in my heart always knew
I'd be lying here beside you

On my own
On my own
On my own

So many promises never should be spoken
Now I know what loving you cost
Now we're up to talking divorce
And we weren't even married

On my own
Once again now
One more time
By myself
No one said it was easy
No

But it once was so easy

Well, I believed in love (I believe)
Now here I stand
I wonder why
Ooh

I'm on my own
Why did it end this way
(On my own)
This wasn't how it was supposed to be
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again

So many times
I know I could have told you
Losing you
It cut like a knife
Hey
You walked out and there went my life
I don't want to live without you

On my own
This wasn't how it was supposed to end
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again
On my own
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone
By myself
On my own
I've got to find out where I belong again
I've got to learn to be strong again
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone
By myself, by myself, by myself
I've got to find out what was mine again
My heart is saying that it's time again
And I have faith that I will shine again
By myself
I have faith in me
Oh
I know I'll make it
By myself, by myself
