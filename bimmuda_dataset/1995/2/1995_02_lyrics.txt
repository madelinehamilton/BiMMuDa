A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time, he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep hisself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, "Baby, it's good to me"
One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading, and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
(Your way or no way)
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Come on!
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray
All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast)
Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go)
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
(I know, I know, your way hey)
But I think you're moving too fast
