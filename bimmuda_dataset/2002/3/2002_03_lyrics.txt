I see you drivin' sports cars, ain't hittin' the throttle
And I'll be down to do a hundred, top down and goggles
Got off the freeway, exit 106, and parked it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game 'cause, baby, I can't talk it

Vokal tanktop on at this point
You wit' a winner so, baby, you can't lose
I got secrets can't leave Cancun
