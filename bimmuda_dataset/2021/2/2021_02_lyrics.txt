Ooh (Ooh)
Na-na, yeah

I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

I don't know why I run away (Oh)
I make you cry when I run away (Oh)

Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day (Mm)

Met you once under a Pisces moon
I kept my distance 'cause I know that you
Don't like when I'm with nobody else
I couldn't help it, I put you through hell

I don't know why I run away, oh boy (Run away, oh yeah; oh)
I make you cry when I run away (Away, oh; oh)

Boy, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that it's much too late
And you deserve someone better

Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day (Oh)

(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't know why I run away (Oh)
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I make you cry when I run away (Save)

Save your tears for another day (Ooh; oh)
Ooh, girl, I said (Okay)
Save (Save) your (Your) tears for another day (Oh yeah, yeah; oh)

Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day
