And when I go away
I know my heart can stay with my love
It's understood, it's in the hands of my love
And my love does it good

Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
My love does it good

And when the cupboard's bare
I'll still find something there with my love
It's understood, it's everywhere with my love
And my love does it good

Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
My love does it good

Oh, I love, oh, my love
Only my love holds the other key to me
Oh, my love, oh, my love
Only my love does it good to me

Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
My love does it good

Don't ever ask me why
I never say goodbye to my love
It's understood, it's everywhere with my love
And my love, she does it good

Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
Wo, wo-wo, wo
My love does it good

Oh oh, I love, oh oh, my love
Only my love does it good to me
Wo, wo, wo, wo
Wo oh, wo oh, wo
