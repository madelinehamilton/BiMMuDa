I’ve been really trying, baby
Trying to hold back this feeling for so long
And if you feel like I feel, baby
Come on, oh, come on, ooh

Let’s get it on, ow baby
Let’s get it on, let’s love baby
Let’s get it on, sugar
Let’s get it on, woo

We’re all sensitive people with so much to give
Understand me, sugar
Since we got to be, let’s live, I love you
There’s nothing wrong with me loving you, baby, no, no
And giving yourself to me can never be wrong
If the love is true, oh, baby, ooh

Don’t you know how sweet and wonderful life can be, ooh-ooh
I’m asking you, baby, to get it on with me, ooh-ooh-ooh
I ain't gonna worry, I ain't gonna push, I won't push you, baby
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, baby
Stop beating 'round the bush, hey

Let's get it on, let's get it on
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Come on, baby, let your love come out
If you believe in love
Let's get it on, let's get it on baby
This minute, oh yeah, let's get it on
Please, let's get it on, hey, hey

I know you know what I been dreamin' of, don't you, baby?
My whole body makes that feelin' of love, I'm happy
I ain't gonna worry, no, I ain't gonna push
I won't push you, baby, woo
Come on, come on, come on, come on, darling
Stop beatin' 'round the bush, hey

Oh, gonna get it on, threatenin' you, baby
I wanna get it on
You don't have to worry that it's wrong
If the spirit moves you
Let me groove you good
Let your love come down
Oh, get it on, come on, baby
Do you know the meaning?
I've been sanctified, hey, hey
Girl, you give me good feeling
So good, somethin' like sanctified
Oh dear I, baby
Nothing wrong with love
If you want to love me, just let yourself go
Oh baby, let's get it on
