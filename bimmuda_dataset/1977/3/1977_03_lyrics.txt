Doesn't take much to make me happy
And make me smile with glee
Never never will I feel discouraged
Cause our love's no mystery
Demonstrating love and affection
That you give so openly yeah
I like the way you make me feel about you baby
Want the whole wide world to see

Whoa whoa, you got the best of my love
Whoa whoa, you got the best of my love
Whoa whoa, you got the best of my love
Whoa whoa, you got the best of my love

Goin' in and out of changes
The kind that come around each day
My life has a better meaning
Love has kissed me in a beautiful way

And oh yea (my love, my love)
Oh yea (my love, my love)

Oh, you got the best of my love
Whoa whoa, you got the best of my love
Whoa whoa, you got the best of my love
Whoa whoa, you got the best of my love

Demonstrating sweet love and affection
That you give so openly yeah
The way I feel about you baby can't explain it
Want the whole wide world to see

Oh, but in my heart
You're all I need
You for me and me for you (my love, my love)
Oh, it's growin' every day, oh (my love, my love)

Oh, oh oh oh oh oh
You've got the best of my love
Oh, oh oh oh oh oh
