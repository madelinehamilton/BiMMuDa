How much is that doggie in the window? (Arf, arf)
The one with the waggly tail
How much is that doggie in the window? (Arf, arf)
I do hope that doggie's for sale

I must take a trip to California
And leave my poor sweetheart alone
If he has a dog he won't be lonesome
And the doggie will have a good home

How much is that doggie in the window? (Arf, arf)
The one with the waggly tail
How much is that doggie in the window? (Arf, arf)
I do hope that doggie's for sale

I read in the paper there are robbers (Arf, arf)
With flash lights that shine in the dark
My love needs a doggie to protect him
And scare them away with one bark
I don't want a bunny or a kitty
I don't want a parrot that talks
I don't want a bowl of little fishies
He can't take a goldfish for a walk

How much is that doggie in the window? (Arf, arf)
The one with the waggly tail
How much is that doggie in the window? (Arf, arf)
I do hope that doggie's for sale
