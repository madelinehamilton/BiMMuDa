Girl, I’ve been watching you
From so far across the floor, now, baby
That’s nothing new, I’ve watched you
So many times before, now, baby
I see that look in your eyes (look in your eyes)
And what it’s telling me
And you know, ooh girl, that I’m not shy
I’m glad you picked up on my telepathy, now, baby

You read my mind (You know you did)
Girl I wanna shake you down (oh well, oh well)
I can give you all the lovin’ you need
(I’m gonna love you)
Come on let me take you down (oh, baby)
We’ll go all the way to heaven

Ooooh, I been missing you
And the way you make me feel inside
What can I do? I can tell you’ve got your pride now, baby
Come to me (oh well, oh well)
Let me ease your mind (oh babe)
I’ve got the remedy, yes I do
Now give me just a little time

(Here in my mind, Girl, I wanna shake you down)
I wanna rock you down
(I can give you all the lovin you need)
I’m gonna love you
(Come on let me take you down)
Oh well or well
(We’ll go all the way to heaven)

Girl, I’ve been missing you
And you know, it’s funny
Every time I get to feelin' this way
I wish I had you near me
I wanna reach out and touch you…

I can’t stop thinking of the things we do
The way you call me baby when I’m holding you
I shake and I shiver when I know you’re near
Then you whisper in my ear (oh baby, well, well)

You read my mind (You know you did)
Girl I wanna shake you down (oh well, oh well)
I can give you all the lovin’ you need
(I’m gonna love you)
Come on let me take you down (oh, baby)
We’ll go all the way to heaven

Eeny-meeny-miny-mo (You read my mind)
Come on, girl, let’s shock the show (Girl, I wanna shake you down)
(I can give you all the lovin' you need)
Roses are red and violets are blue
I’m gonna rock this world for you
Hey Baby
(We’ll go all the way to heaven
You read my mind)
Girl, I wanna shake you down
I can give you all the lovin’ you need
Come on, let me take you down
We’ll go all the way to heaven
