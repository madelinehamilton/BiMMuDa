Auf wiedersehen, auf wiedersehen
We'll meet again, sweetheart
This lovely day has flown away
The time has come to part

We'll kiss again, like this again
Don't let the teardrops start
With love that's true, I'll wait for you
Auf wiedersehen, sweetheart

Auf wiedersehen, auf wiedersehen
We'll meet again, sweetheart
This lovely day has flown away
The time has come to part

We'll kiss again, like this again
Don't let the teardrops start
With love that's true, I'll wait for you
Auf wiedersehen, sweetheart
