The wheel of fortune
Goes spinning around
Will the arrow point my way
Will this be my day

Oh, wheel of fortune
Please don't pass me by
Let me know the magic
Of a kiss and a sigh

While the wheel is spinning
Spinning, spinning, spinning
I'll not dream of winning
Winning fortune or fame

While the wheel is turning
Turning, turning, turning
I'll be ever yearning, yearning
For love's precious flame

Oh, wheel of fortune
I'm hoping somehow
If you ever smile on me
Please let it be now
