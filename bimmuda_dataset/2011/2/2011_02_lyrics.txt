In the club: Party rock
Looking for your girl? She on my jock (Huh)
Non-stop when we in the spot
Booty moving weight like she on the block (Woo!)
Where the drank? I gots to know
Tight jeans, tattoo, 'cause I'm rock and roll
Half-black, half-white: domino
Gainin' money, Oprah, dough

Yo! I'm running through these hoes like Drano
I got that devilish flow rock and roll no halo, we party rock!
Yeah, that’s the crew that I'm reppin'
On the rise to the top, no Led in our Zeppelin (Hey!)

Party rockers in the house tonight (Woo!)
Everybody just have a good time (Yeah)
And we gon' make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time (Let's go!)

Every day I'm shufflin' (Shake)
Shufflin', shufflin' (Shake)

Step up fast and be the first girl to make me throw this cash
We get money, don't be mad, now stop - hatin' is bad
One more shot for us (Another round!)
Please fill up my cup (Don't mess around!)
We just wanna see (You shake it now!)
Now you wanna be (You're naked now!)

Get up, get down, put your hands up to the sound
