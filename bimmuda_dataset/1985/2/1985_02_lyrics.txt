I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was until I found you
I was beat, incomplete
I'd been had, I was sad and blue, but you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats next to mine

Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you, 'cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah you make me bold, oh your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out what was scared and cold

Like a virgin (Hey)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa, ah
Whoa whoa whoa

You're so fine and you're mine
I'll be yours 'til the end of time 'cause you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel I've nothing to hide

Like a virgin (Hey)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

Like a virgin
Ooh-ooh, like a virgin
Feels so good inside
When you hold me, and your heart beats, and you love me
Oh-ooh oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh baby, yeah
Can't you hear my heart beat for the very first time?
