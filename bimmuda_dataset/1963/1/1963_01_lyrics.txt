If everybody had an ocean
Across the U.S.A
Then everybody'd be surfin'
Like Californi-a
You'd see them wearing their baggies
Huarache sandals too
A bushy bushy blond hairdo
Surfin' U.S.A

You'd catch 'em surfin' at Del Mar

Ventura County line
(Inside, outside, U.S.A.)
Santa Cruz and Trestles

Australia's Narrabeen

All over Manhattan

Everybody's gone surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A

We'll all be planning that route
We're gonna take real soon
We're waxing down our surfboards
We can't wait for June
We'll all be gone for the summer
We're on surfari to stay
Tell the teacher we're surfin'
Surfin' U.S.A
