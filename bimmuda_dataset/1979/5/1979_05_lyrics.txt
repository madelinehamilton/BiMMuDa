I was a fool to ever leave your side
Me minus you is such a lonely ride
The breakup we had
Has made me lonesome and sad
I realize I love you 'cause I
Want you back
Hey, hey

I spent the evening with the radio
Regret the moment that I let you go
Our quarrel was such
A way of learnin' so much
I know now that I love you 'cause I
Need your touch
Hey, hey

Reunited
And it feels so good
Reunited
'Cause we understood

There's one perfect fit
And sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited 'cause we're
Reunited
Hey, hey

I sat here starin' at the same old wall
Came back to life just when I got your call
I wished I could climb
Right through the telephone line
And give you what you want so you would
Still be mine
Hey, hey

I can't go cheatin', honey, I can't play
I found it very hard to stay away
As we reminisce
On precious moments like this
I'm glad we're back together 'cause I
Missed your kiss
Hey, hey

Reunited
And it feels so good
Reunited
'Cause we understood

There's one perfect fit
And sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited 'cause we're
Reunited
Hey, hey

Oh, lover, lover
This is solid love
And you're exactly what I'm dreaming of
All through the day, and all through the night
I`ll give you all the love I have
With all my might
Hey, hey

Reunited
And it feels so good
Reunited
Cause we understood

There's one perfect fit
And sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited 'cause we're
Reunited
Hey, hey

Listen baby
I won't ever let you cry, I won't let one day go by
Without holding you, without kissing you
Without loving you
Reunited
You're my everything
Only you know how to free
All the love there is in me
I wanna let you know, I won't let you go
I wanna let you know, I won't let you go
Reunited

Reunited
And it feels so good
Reunited
Cause we understood

There's one perfect fit
And sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited 'cause we're
Reunited
