All you got is this moment
Twenty-first century's yesterday
You can care all you want
Everybody does, yeah, that's okay

So slide over here
And give me a moment
Your moves are so raw
I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know
You're one of my kind

I need you tonight
'Cause I'm not sleeping
There's something about you, girl
That makes me sweat

How do you feel?
I'm lonely
What do you think?
Can't think at all
What'cha gonna do?
Gonna live my life

So slide over here
And give me a moment
Your moves are so raw
I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know
You're one of my kind

I need you tonight
'Cause I'm not sleeping
There's something about you girl
That makes me sweat

So how do you feel?
I'm lonely
What do you think?
Can't think at all
Whatcha gonna do?
Gonna live my life
How do you feel?
