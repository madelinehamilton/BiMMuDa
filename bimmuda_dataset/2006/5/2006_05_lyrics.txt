Ladies up in here tonight
No fighting (We got the refugees up in here)
No fighting
No fighting
Shakira, Shakira

I never really knew that she could dance like this (Hey)
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama (Sí!), bonita? (Sí!)
Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)
Oh baby, when you talk like that (Huh-uh) (Yeah)
You make a woman go mad (Oh)
So be wise (Sí!) and keep on (Sí!)
Reading the signs of my body (Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)
No fighting

I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie (No fighting)
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see, baby? This is perfection

Hey girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy (Huh-uh)
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing (Yeah)
That when you walk up on the dance floor, nobody cannot ignore
The way you move your body, girl (Just smooth)
And everything's so unexpected, the way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it (Let's go)

I never really knew that she could dance like this (Hey)
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama (Sí!), bonita? (Sí!)
Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)
Oh baby, when you talk like that (Huh-uh) (Oh)
You make a woman go mad (So bad) (Oh)
So be wise (Sí!) and keep on (Sí!)
Reading the signs of my body
No fighting

I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie (No fighting)
And I'm starting to feel you, boy (Yeah)
Come on, let's go, real slow
Don't you see, baby? Así es perfecto
They know I'm on tonight (Yeah)
My hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby? This is perfection (Shakira, Shakira)

Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan (Yeah)
My will and self-restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't, so, you know
That's a bit too hard to explain (Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)

Baila en la calle de noche (Uh, yeah)
Baila en la calle de día (Let's go!)
Baila en la calle de noche (Uh, yeah)
Baila en la calle de día (Let's go!)

I never really knew that she could dance like this (Hey)
She make a man wanna speak Spanish (Yeah)
¿Cómo se llama (Sí!), bonita? (Sí!)
Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)
Oh baby, when you talk like that (Huh-uh) (Oh)
You know you got me hypnotized (Oh)
So be wise (Sí! Uh) and keep on (Sí! Uh)
Reading the signs of my body (Yeah)

Señorita, feel the conga
Let me see you move like you come from Colombia
Yeah, oh, yeah, ladies, sí! (Yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
Mira, en Barranquilla se baila así, say it! (Yeah)
En Barranquilla se baila así (Yeah)

Yeah, she's so sexy, every man's fantasy
A refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third world country (Huh-uh)
I go back like when 'Pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
We leave the whole club jazzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
It's the Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
Bo-bop-so-bop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas, 'cause we own our own boats, boats (No fighting)

I'm on tonight
My hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you, boy
Come on, let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto (No fighting)
Oh, you know I'm on tonight
My hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
The attraction, the tension
Baby, like this is perfection

No fighting
