Love
Love will keep us together
Think of me, babe whenever
Some sweet talking girl comes along
Singing his song
Don't mess around
You just got to be strong

Just stop
Cause I really love you
Stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart
And let love keep us together

You
You belong to me now
Ain't gonna set you free now
When those girls start hanging around
Talking me down
Hear with your heart
And you won't hear a sound

Just stop
Cause I really love you
Stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart
And let love keep us together

Young and beautiful
Someday your looks will be gone
When the others turn you off
Who'll be turnin' you on
I will, I will, I will
I will, be there to share forever

Love will keep us together
I said it before
And I'll say it again
While others pretend
I need you now and I need you then

Just stop
Cause I really love you
Stop, I'll be thinking of you
Look in my heart
And let love keep us together
Whatever
Whatever, I will, I will, I will, I will

You better stop
Cause I really love you
Stop, I've been thinkin' of you
Look in my heart
And let love keep us together
Whatever
Whatever, I will, I will, I will
