Round, round, get around
I get around, yeah
Get around, round, round, I get around
I get around
Get around, round, round, I get around
From town to town
Get around, round, round, I get around
I'm a real cool head
Get around, round, round, I get around
I'm making real good bread
Get around, round, round, I get around

I'm getting bugged driving up and down this same old strip
I gotta find a new place where the kids are hip
My buddies and me are getting real well-known
Yeah, the bad guys know us and they leave us alone

I get around
Get around, round, round, I get around
From town to town
Get around, round, round, I get around
I'm a real cool head
Get around, round, round, I get around
I'm making real good bread
Get around, round, round, I get around
I get around, round
Get around, round, round, oooh
Wah wa ooh
Wah wa ooh
Wah wa ooh

We always take my car 'cause it's never been beat
And we've never missed yet with the girls we meet
None of the guys go steady 'cause it wouldn't be right
To leave their best girl home on a Saturday night

I get around
Get around, round, round, I get around
From town to town
Get around, round, round, I get around
I'm a real cool head
Get around, round, round, I get around
I'm making real good bread
Get around, round, round, I get around
I get around, round
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

Round, round, get around
I get around, yeah
Get around, round, round, I get around
Get around, round, round, I get around
Wah wa oooh
Get around, round, round, I get around
Ooooh
Get around, round, round, I get around
Ooooh
Get around, round, round, I get around
I get around
Get around, round, round, I get around
From town to town
Get around, round, round, I get around
Ooooh
Get around, round, round, I get around
Ooooh
Get around, round, round, I get around
