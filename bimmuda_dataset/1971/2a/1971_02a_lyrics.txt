Wake up, Maggie
I think I got something to say to you
It's late September and
I really should be back at school

I know I keep you amused
But I feel I'm being used
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts

The morning sun, when it's in your face
Really shows your age
That don't worry me none
In my eyes, you're everything

I laughed at all of your jokes
My love you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover, and mother what a lover!
You wore me out

All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool

Or find myself a rock & roll band
That needs a helping hand
Oh, Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway

Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face
I'll get on back home one of these days, ooh, ooh, ooh
