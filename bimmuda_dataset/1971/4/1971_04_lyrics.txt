I can tell you've been hurt
By that look on your face, girl
Some guy brought sad
Into your happy world

You need love
But you're afraid that if you give in
Someone else will come along
And sock it to you again

One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch, girl
Oh, give it one more try
Before you give up on love

One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch, girl
Oh, I don't care what they say
I don't care what you heard

I could make you happy, baby
Satisfy you, too
But how can I
If you won't give me a chance to prove my love to you?
Won't you just give me one chance?
I'll give you my guarantee That you won't be hurt again

One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch, girl
Oh, give it one more try
Before you give up on love

One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch, girl
Oh, I don't care what they say
I don't care what you heard now

I've been noticing you, baby
For a long, long time
And I'm not ashamed to tell the world
That you really messed up my mind

Girl, to me you're like a dream come true
I'd rather hurt myself
Than to ever hurt you

One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch, girl
Oh, give it one more try
Before you give up on love, girl

One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch, girl
Oh, I don't care what they say
I don't care what you heard now

One bad apple don't spoil the whole bunch, girl
